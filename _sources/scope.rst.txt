After transitioning from industrial applications of massive scale image
classification, a variety of stochastic inference and statistical learning
methods have gained a momentum in various fields of experimental and
computational science. The large data sets collected during scientific
experiments and computational simulations continue to overwhelm both in terms
of size and processing capacity of even the largest supercomputing
installations.  The modern data analytics methods provide a wide range of
possibilities to tackle these issues effectively and, with the help of HPC, at
large system scales.

The workshop is meant to bring together new developments and applications of
large scale data analytics to modern scientific applications and libraries. It
will offer a broad view of current state-of-the-art in deep-learning,
hyper-parameter search, and data representation combined with the
parallelization and HPC techniques on top of modern supercomputing software
and/or hardware stacks in service of computational science. In other words, the
workshop will feature HPC-enabled statistical learning applied to scientific
data sets and large computational simulations and the related integration
efforts across a number of scientific disciplines.
